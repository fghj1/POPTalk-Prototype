        NOTE: If this configuration variable is set [to anything], it will be
              used instead of the application base directory by the native
              library pre-loader.  This environment variable can be especially
              useful in ASP.NET and other hosted environments where direct
              control of the location of the managed assemblies is not under
              the control of the application.
